# minecraft-server-tools

A bunch of utilities for easily working with and managing minecraft servers, specifically aimed at managing minecraft forge servers with large numbers of manually-installed mods.

## Installing mods with this package

If I directed you here to install Minecraft mods, you'll need to follow the following steps:

1. Install [OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download) and accept my invitation to access 'Minecraft Mods'.
2. Install [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Open a command prompt and run `git clone https://github.com/evhub/minecraft-server-tools.git`.
4. Run `install-client.bat` on Windows or `install-client.sh` otherwise.
