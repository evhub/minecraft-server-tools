# minecraft-server-tools

A bunch of utilities for easily working with and managing minecraft servers, specifically aimed at managing minecraft forge servers with large numbers of manually-installed mods.

## Installing mods with this package

If I directed you here to install Minecraft mods, you'll need to follow the following steps:

1. Install [OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download) and accept my invitation to access 'Minecraft Mods'.
2. Install [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3910), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows).
3. Install [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download) and launch it at least once.
4. Open a command prompt, `cd` to wherever you want to clone the repository, and run `git clone https://github.com/evhub/minecraft-server-tools.git`.
5. Run `install-client.bat` on Windows or `install-client.sh` otherwise (you may need to run `chmod +x ./install-client.sh` first).
